Functions:           57
  Imported:           5
  Non-imported:      52
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 7.02% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      8204
  call:             146 (1.78% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     13 (0.16% of all instructions, 8.18% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 72496
      9 × global.get   18 × global.set   27 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      9 (17.31% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
