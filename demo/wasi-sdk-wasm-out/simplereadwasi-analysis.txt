Functions:           49
  Imported:           9
  Non-imported:      40
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      6398
  call:              78 (1.22% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 67088
      8 × global.get   16 × global.set   24 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      8 (20.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
