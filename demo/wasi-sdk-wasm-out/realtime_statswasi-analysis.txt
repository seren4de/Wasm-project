Functions:           90
  Imported:           8
  Non-imported:      82
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 5.56% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     21182
  call:             283 (1.34% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     15 (0.07% of all instructions, 5.03% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 72992
     25 × global.get   43 × global.set   68 total (37/63% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     25 (30.49% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
