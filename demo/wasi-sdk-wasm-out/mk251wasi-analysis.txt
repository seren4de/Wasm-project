Input file: mk251wasi.wasm
  binary:    mk251wasi.wasm

Functions:           30
  Imported:           5
  Non-imported:      25
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 13.33% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       778
  call:              29 (3.73% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      9 (1.16% of all instructions, 23.68% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 67744
      6 × global.get   12 × global.set   18 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      6 (24.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    1  (4.00%) × [-32]
    4 (16.00%) × [-16]
   20 (80.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 5 (20.00%)

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     5 × unrestricted                         source:   i32.load   type [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]

         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              2
     4 × unrestricted                         source:   i32.load   type [i32, i64, i32] -> [i64]
