Functions:           52
  Imported:           5
  Non-imported:      47
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 9.62% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      7851
  call:             138 (1.76% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     14 (0.18% of all instructions, 9.21% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70336
     11 × global.get   20 × global.set   31 total (35/65% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     11 (23.40% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
