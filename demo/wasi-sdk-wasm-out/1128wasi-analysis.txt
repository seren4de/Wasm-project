Functions:           99
  Imported:          12
  Non-imported:      87
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 5.05% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     13849
  call:             243 (1.75% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     22 (0.16% of all instructions, 8.30% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 74384
     21 × global.get   42 × global.set   63 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     21 (24.14% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
