Functions:           26
  Imported:           3
  Non-imported:      23
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      4944
  call:              43 (0.87% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 67072
     5 × global.get   6 × global.set  11 total (45/55% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      5 (21.74% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    2  (8.70%) × [-16]
   21 (91.30%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 2 (8.70%)

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 0 (0.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
  0 call_indirect patterns in total
