Functions:           94
  Imported:           9
  Non-imported:      85
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 5.32% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     21400
  call:             326 (1.52% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     15 (0.07% of all instructions, 4.40% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 71696
     20 × global.get   38 × global.set   58 total (34/66% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     20 (23.53% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
