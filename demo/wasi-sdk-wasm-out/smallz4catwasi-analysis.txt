Functions:           91
  Imported:          12
  Non-imported:      79
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          7
  Of those, unique functions:     7 (i.e., at least 7.69% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     11722
  call:             156 (1.33% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     51 (0.44% of all instructions, 24.64% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 69776
     21 × global.get   41 × global.set   62 total (34/66% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     21 (26.58% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
