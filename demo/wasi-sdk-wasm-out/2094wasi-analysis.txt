Functions:          110
  Imported:          12
  Non-imported:      98
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 4.55% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     15841
  call:             302 (1.91% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     19 (0.12% of all instructions, 5.92% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 71312
     27 × global.get   54 × global.set   81 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     27 (27.55% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
