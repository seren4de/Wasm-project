Functions:           53
  Imported:           5
  Non-imported:      48
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 7.55% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      8239
  call:             144 (1.75% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     13 (0.16% of all instructions, 8.28% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70528
     13 × global.get   23 × global.set   36 total (36/64% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     13 (27.08% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
