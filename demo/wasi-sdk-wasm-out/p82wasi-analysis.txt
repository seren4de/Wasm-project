Functions:           68
  Imported:           7
  Non-imported:      61
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          3
  Of those, unique functions:     3 (i.e., at least 4.41% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     12322
  call:             173 (1.40% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     13 (0.11% of all instructions, 6.99% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 69760
     17 × global.get   23 × global.set   40 total (42/58% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     17 (27.87% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
