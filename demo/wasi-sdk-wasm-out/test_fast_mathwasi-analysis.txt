Functions:           71
  Imported:           7
  Non-imported:      64
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 5.63% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     15710
  call:             210 (1.34% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     15 (0.10% of all instructions, 6.67% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70832
     14 × global.get   28 × global.set   42 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     14 (21.88% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
