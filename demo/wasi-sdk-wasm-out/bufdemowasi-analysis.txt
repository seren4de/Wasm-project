Functions:           76
  Imported:           8
  Non-imported:      68
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 6.58% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     12951
  call:             182 (1.41% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     16 (0.12% of all instructions, 8.08% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 71952
     19 × global.get   38 × global.set   57 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     19 (27.94% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
