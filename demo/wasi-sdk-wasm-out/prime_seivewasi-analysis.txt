Functions:           66
  Imported:           7
  Non-imported:      59
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 6.06% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     12321
  call:             169 (1.37% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     13 (0.11% of all instructions, 7.14% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70912
     16 × global.get   27 × global.set   43 total (37/63% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     16 (27.12% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
