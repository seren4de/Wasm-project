Functions:           15
  Imported:           3
  Non-imported:      12
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       217
  call:              25 (11.52% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66592
     2 × global.get   4 × global.set   6 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      2 (16.67% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    1  (8.33%) × [-16]
