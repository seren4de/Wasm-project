Functions:           88
  Imported:           8
  Non-imported:      80
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 5.68% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     19963
  call:             275 (1.38% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     19 (0.10% of all instructions, 6.46% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 72704
     21 × global.get   38 × global.set   59 total (36/64% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     21 (26.25% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
