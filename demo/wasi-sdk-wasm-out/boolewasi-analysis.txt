Input file: boolewasi.wasm
  binary:    boolewasi.wasm

Functions:          118
  Imported:          12
  Non-imported:     106
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 4.24% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     23064
  call:             362 (1.57% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     20 (0.09% of all instructions, 5.24% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 73056
     30 × global.get   58 × global.set   88 total (34/66% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     30 (28.30% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
