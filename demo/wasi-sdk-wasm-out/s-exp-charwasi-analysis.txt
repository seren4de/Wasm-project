Functions:           11
  Imported:           1
  Non-imported:      10
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       284
  call:              13 (4.58% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66560
     3 × global.get   2 × global.set   5 total (60/40% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      3 (30.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
   10(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (5 unique types):
    1  (9.09%) × [] -> [i32]
    1  (9.09%) × [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
    1  (9.09%) × [i32, i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
    4 (36.36%) × [] -> []
    4 (36.36%) × [i32] -> []

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 0 (0.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
  0 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
  0 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
  total classes: 0
