Functions:          100
  Imported:          12
  Non-imported:      88
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 4.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     13947
  call:             245 (1.76% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     21 (0.15% of all instructions, 7.89% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 69744
     23 × global.get   46 × global.set   69 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     23 (26.14% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
