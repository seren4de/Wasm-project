Functions:           62
  Imported:           7
  Non-imported:      55
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 8.06% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     11836
  call:             161 (1.36% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     15 (0.13% of all instructions, 8.52% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70784
     12 × global.get   23 × global.set   35 total (34/66% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     12 (21.82% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
