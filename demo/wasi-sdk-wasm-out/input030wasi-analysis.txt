Functions:           19
  Imported:           4
  Non-imported:      15
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       308
  call:              21 (6.82% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66656
     3 × global.get   6 × global.set   9 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      3 (20.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    2 (13.33%) × [-16]
   13 (86.67%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 2 (13.33%)
