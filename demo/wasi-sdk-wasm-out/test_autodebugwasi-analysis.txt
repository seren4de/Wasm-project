Functions:           51
  Imported:           5
  Non-imported:      46
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          4
  Of those, unique functions:     4 (i.e., at least 7.84% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      7606
  call:             137 (1.80% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     14 (0.18% of all instructions, 9.27% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 70352
     10 × global.get   20 × global.set   30 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     10 (21.74% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
