Functions:           89
  Imported:           6
  Non-imported:      83
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          5
  Of those, unique functions:     5 (i.e., at least 5.62% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     20799
  call:             277 (1.33% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     15 (0.07% of all instructions, 5.14% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 72864
     26 × global.get   45 × global.set   71 total (37/63% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     26 (31.33% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
