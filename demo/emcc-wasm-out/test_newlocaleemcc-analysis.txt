Functions:           88
  Imported:           8
  Non-imported:      80
  Exported:           9

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          8
  Of those, unique functions:     8 (i.e., at least 9.09% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     10400
  call:             163 (1.57% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      8 (0.08% of all instructions, 4.68% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5246832
     17 × global.get   32 × global.set   49 total (35/65% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      2 × global.get    1 × global.set    3 total (67/33% split)
  #2 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      1 × global.get    1 × global.set    2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     18 (22.50% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
