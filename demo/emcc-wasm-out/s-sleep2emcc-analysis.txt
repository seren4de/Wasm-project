Input file: s-sleep2emcc.wasm
  binary:    s-sleep2emcc.wasm

Functions:           29
  Imported:           2
  Non-imported:      27
  Exported:           9

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 3.45% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       425
  call:              30 (7.06% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (0.24% of all instructions, 3.23% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5243920
      8 × global.get   12 × global.set   20 total (40/60% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      2 × global.get    1 × global.set    3 total (67/33% split)

     init: i32.const 0
      1 × global.get    1 × global.set    2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      9 (33.33% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)

    3 (11.11%) × [-16]
   23 (85.19%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 4 (14.81%)

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
