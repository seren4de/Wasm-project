Input file: test_vsnprintfemcc.wasm
  binary:    test_vsnprintfemcc.wasm

Functions:           74
  Imported:           6
  Non-imported:      68
  Exported:           9

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          9
  Of those, unique functions:     9 (i.e., at least 12.16% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      6136
  call:             141 (2.30% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      9 (0.15% of all instructions, 6.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5246000
     15 × global.get   28 × global.set   43 total (35/65% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      2 × global.get    1 × global.set    3 total (67/33% split)
  #2 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      1 × global.get    1 × global.set    2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     16 (23.53% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
