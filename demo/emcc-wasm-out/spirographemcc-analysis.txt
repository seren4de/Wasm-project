Input file: spirographemcc.wasm
  binary:    spirographemcc.wasm

Functions:          114
  Imported:           7
  Non-imported:     107
  Exported:           9

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:         10
  Of those, unique functions:    10 (i.e., at least 8.77% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:     13647
  call:             242 (1.77% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     12 (0.09% of all instructions, 4.72% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5251536
     26 × global.get   50 × global.set   76 total (34/66% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      2 × global.get    1 × global.set    3 total (67/33% split)
  #2 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      1 × global.get    1 × global.set    2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     27 (25.23% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
