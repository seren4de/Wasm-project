Functions:           22
  Imported:           1
  Non-imported:      21
  Exported:           9

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 4.55% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      3408
  call:              24 (0.70% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (0.03% of all instructions, 4.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5244416
     5 × global.get   6 × global.set  11 total (45/55% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
     2 × global.get   1 × global.set   3 total (67/33% split)
  #2 i32
     init: i32.const 0
     1 × global.get   1 × global.set   2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      6 (28.57% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    1  (4.76%) × [-16]
   20 (95.24%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 1 (4.76%)

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     1 × unrestricted                         source:   i32.load   type [] -> []
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):                5
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    1
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              1
  1 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
