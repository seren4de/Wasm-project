Input file: simplereadllvm.wasm
  binary:    simplereadllvm.wasm

Functions:           12
  Imported:           2
  Non-imported:      10
  Exported:          10

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       418
  call:              16 (3.83% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66560
     3 × global.get   6 × global.set   9 total (33/67% split)
  #1 i32
     export: ["__heap_base"]

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      3 (30.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    1 (10.00%) × [-32]
    1 (10.00%) × [-16]
    8 (80.00%) × []
