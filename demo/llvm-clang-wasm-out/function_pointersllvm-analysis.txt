Input file: function_pointersllvm.wasm
  binary:    function_pointersllvm.wasm

Functions:            5
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:       5
  Exported:           5

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          2
  Of those, unique functions:     2 (i.e., at least 40.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       158
  call:               3 (1.90% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (0.63% of all instructions, 25.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66560
     4 × global.get   6 × global.set  10 total (40/60% split)
  #1 i32
     export: ["__heap_base"]
     init: i32.const 66560
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total
  #2 i32
     export: ["__data_end"]
     init: i32.const 1024
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total
  #3 i32
     export: ["__dso_handle"]
     init: i32.const 1024
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      4 (80.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    5(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (3 unique types):
    1 (20.00%) × [] -> []
    1 (20.00%) × [] -> [i32]
    3 (60.00%) × [i32] -> [i32]

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 1 (20.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
         range: [    1,    2]   length:   2   unique funcs:    2   type: [i32] -> [i32]
  1 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     1 × unrestricted                         source: local.(get|tee)   type [i32] -> [i32]
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):                3
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    2
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              2
  1 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
  class #0
    type: [i32] -> [i32]
    start idx: None, end idx: None
    size (of class): 2
    count (how often class appears): 1
  total classes: 1
