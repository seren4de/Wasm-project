Functions:            2
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:       2
  Exported:           2

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:        33
  call:               0 (0.00% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (3.03% of all instructions, 100.00% of all calls)

Globals:

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      1 (50.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)

Counts of function types (1 unique types):
    2(100.00%) × [] -> []

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 1 (50.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     1 × unrestricted                         source: local.(get|tee)   type [] -> []
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):                2
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    0
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              0
  1 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
  class #0
    type: [] -> []
    start idx: None, end idx: None
    size (of class): 0
    count (how often class appears): 1
  total classes: 1
