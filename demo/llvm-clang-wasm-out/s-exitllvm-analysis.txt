Input file: s-exitllvm.wasm
  binary:    s-exitllvm.wasm

Functions:            8
  Imported:           1
  Non-imported:       7
  Exported:           6

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       106
  call:               9 (8.49% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (0.94% of all instructions, 10.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 66560
     2 × global.get   3 × global.set   5 total (40/60% split)
  #1 i32
     export: ["__heap_base"]
     init: i32.const 66560
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total
  #2 i32
     export: ["__data_end"]
     init: i32.const 1024

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      2 (28.57% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    7(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (3 unique types):
    2 (25.00%) × [i32, i32] -> [i32]
    3 (37.50%) × [] -> []
    3 (37.50%) × [i32] -> []

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 1 (14.29% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
  0 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     1 × unrestricted                         source:   i32.load   type [] -> []
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):                3
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    0
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              0
  1 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
  class #0
    type: [] -> []
    start idx: None, end idx: None
    size (of class): 0
    count (how often class appears): 1
  total classes: 1
