Functions:            7
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:       7
  Exported:           7

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          0
  Of those, unique functions:     0 (i.e., at least 0.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       716
  call:               5 (0.70% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      2 (28.57% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
