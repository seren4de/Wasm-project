  Table entries at init:         10
  Of those, unique functions:    10 (i.e., at least 18.52% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      6451
  call:              92 (1.43% of all instructions)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      4 (8.16% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
