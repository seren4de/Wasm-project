  Table entries at init:         12
  Of those, unique functions:    12 (i.e., at least 19.05% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      7470
  call:              85 (1.14% of all instructions)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     10 (16.67% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
