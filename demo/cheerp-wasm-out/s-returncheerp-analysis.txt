Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 12.50% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       765
  call:               6 (0.78% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      3 (37.50% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
