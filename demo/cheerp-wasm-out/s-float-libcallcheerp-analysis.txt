Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 7.14% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      1668
  call:              22 (1.32% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      6 (42.86% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
