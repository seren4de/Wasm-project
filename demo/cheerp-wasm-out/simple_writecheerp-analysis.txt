Functions:           14
  Imported:           4
  Non-imported:      10
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          2
  Of those, unique functions:     2 (i.e., at least 14.29% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       747
  call:              10 (1.34% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      0 (0.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
   10(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (6 unique types):
    1  (7.14%) × [] -> [i32]
    1  (7.14%) × [i32, i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
    2 (14.29%) × [] -> []
    2 (14.29%) × [i32] -> []
    2 (14.29%) × [i32, i32] -> []
    6 (42.86%) × [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 0 (0.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
         range: [    0,    0]   length:   1   unique funcs:    1   type: [] -> []
         range: [    1,    1]   length:   1   unique funcs:    1   type: [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
  2 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
