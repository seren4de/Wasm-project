Functions:            5
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:       5
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 20.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:       662
  call:               0 (0.00% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      1 (0.15% of all instructions, 100.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     0 × global.get   0 × global.set   0 total

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      0 (0.00% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
    5(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (3 unique types):
    1 (20.00%) × [] -> []
    1 (20.00%) × [] -> [i32]
    3 (60.00%) × [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 1 (20.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
         range: [    0,    0]   length:   1   unique funcs:    1   type: [] -> []
  1 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     1 × fixed index:  1048584                  source:  i32.const   type: [] -> []
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):                1
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    1
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              0
  1 call_indirect patterns in total
