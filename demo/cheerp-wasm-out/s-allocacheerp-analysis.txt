Functions:           11
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:      11
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:          1
  Of those, unique functions:     1 (i.e., at least 9.09% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      1132
  call:              10 (0.88% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      0 (0.00% of all instructions, 0.00% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     1 × global.get   1 × global.set   2 total (50/50% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      1 (9.09% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
   11(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (5 unique types):
    1  (9.09%) × [] -> []
    1  (9.09%) × [i32, i32] -> [i32]
    1  (9.09%) × [i32, i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
    3 (27.27%) × [i32] -> [i32]
    5 (45.45%) × [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 0 (0.00% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
         range: [    0,    0]   length:   1   unique funcs:    1   type: [] -> []
  1 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
  0 call_indirect patterns in total
