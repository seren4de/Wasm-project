Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:         13
  Of those, unique functions:    13 (i.e., at least 19.12% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      8862
  call:             113 (1.28% of all instructions)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:     12 (18.46% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
