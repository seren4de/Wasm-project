Functions:           17
  Imported:           0
  Non-imported:      17
  Exported:           1

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:         10
  Of those, unique functions:    10 (i.e., at least 58.82% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:      1210
  call:              12 (0.99% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:      2 (0.17% of all instructions, 14.29% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     10 × global.get   27 × global.set   37 total (27/73% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:      9 (52.94% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
   17(100.00%) × []
  functions with stack allocation total: 0 (0.00%)

Counts of function types (5 unique types):
    1  (5.88%) × [] -> []
    1  (5.88%) × [i32, i32] -> [i32]
    1  (5.88%) × [i32, i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
    4 (23.53%) × [i32, i32, i32] -> [i32]
   10 (58.82%) × [i32] -> [i32]

Functions with at least one call_indirect: 1 (5.88% of all functions)

Table elements initialization:
         range: [    0,    0]   length:   1   unique funcs:    1   type: [] -> []
         range: [    1,    9]   length:   9   unique funcs:    9   type: [i32] -> [i32]
  2 table init ranges in total

Patterns (=preceding instructions) of call_indirect:
     2 × unrestricted                         source:   i32.load   type [i32] -> [i32]
         functions matching by type (regardless whether they are in the table):               10
         functions matching by type and present in table (regardless at which table index):    9
         functions matching by type and present in permissable table index range:              9
  1 call_indirect patterns in total


call_indirect target equivalence classes (CFI equivalence classes):
  class #0
    type: [i32] -> [i32]
    start idx: None, end idx: None
    size (of class): 9
    count (how often class appears): 2
